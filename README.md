# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoder and Logistic Regression
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically autoencoder neural networks and logistic regression. The goal is to build robust models that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## Key Features:


## Autoencoder Model: 
Developed an autoencoder neural network to learn a compressed representation of the input data and reconstruct the original features. This model is trained on normal transactions to capture their underlying patterns.

## Logistic Regression Model: 
Utilized logistic regression to classify transactions based on their hidden representations obtained from the autoencoder. This approach helps in distinguishing between normal and fraudulent transactions.

## Evaluation Metrics: 
Calculated and visualized evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve to assess model performance.

## Model Comparison: 
Compared the performance of the autoencoder-based approach with traditional logistic regression to determine the most effective method for fraud detection.

## GitHub Repository: 
This repository contains the code, dataset, and documentation for the credit card fraud detection project, making it accessible for further research and contributions.
